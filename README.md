This application has been developed using Flutter based on the design from the [website](https://tobeto.com/) for Tobeto Education Platform.

## Features

- Localized in Multiple Languages

  The application supports 3 different languages. Turkish: full support, English and German: limited support, with only specific pages translated into these languages.

  Our application includes a comprehensive user profile management system that enables users to create and personalize their profiles. From registering for an account to updating their information, users can showcase their professional experiences, education history, skills, and include links to their social media profiles.

  - **Registration and Login:** Easily create an account and log in securely.
  - **Profile Editing:** Update personal information, work experiences, education history, and skills.

- Admin Management Screens

  Our application includes comprehensive admin management screens that empower administrators with powerful tools to oversee and manage various aspects of the platform. Admins can perform tasks such as making announcements, reviewing and approving student applications, managing content entries, scheduling events, creating courses, and more.

  Key Features and Capabilities

  - **Announcements**: Create and publish announcements visible to all users.
  - **Application Management**: Review and approve/deny student applications.

- User Rank System

  Our application features a structured user rank system that categorizes users into three distinct roles: Student, Instructor, and Admin. Each role comes with specific privileges and access to tailored features, enhancing the overall user experience and functionality of the app.

  Key Roles and Privileges

  - **Student**

    - Access to learning materials and courses.
    - Ability to track progress and achievements.

  When you watch a course video, your watched progress is saved to the database. This allows you to continue watching from where you left off the next time you access the video. The feature ensures a seamless learning experience by keeping track of your progress.

- Light and Dark Theme Support

  This application offers users the flexibility to choose between light and dark themes according to their preference. Whether you prefer a brighter interface or a darker one for reduced eye strain in low-light environments, our app adapts to suit your needs.
